          may collect and process the following data about you: • Information
          that you provide when you fill in forms on our site, such as your
          name, username, password, date of birth, address, email address,
          gender and location. Some of this information, for example, your name
          and username, is listed publicly on our site and services, including
          on your profile page and in search results. We may also ask you for
          information when you report a problem with our site and/or services. •
          Additional information when you provide us with profile information to
          make public, such as a micro biography, your website, or a picture.

          choose to operate. • If you connect your Bootbag account to your

          that you access. 3. PUBLIC INFORMATION Most of the information you
          provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This
          includes not only content you post and the metadata provided with the
          posts, such as when you posted, but also the lists you create, the
          people you follow, the posts you mark as favourites that result from
          your use of our site and services. Our default is almost always to
          make the information you provide public for as long as you do not

          make the information generally more private if you want. This can be
          altered in your Profile Visibility in Account Settings. Your public
          information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your
          public user profile information and public posts may be searchable by
