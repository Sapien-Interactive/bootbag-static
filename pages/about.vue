          <h1>About</h1>

          Bootbag was formed out of a passion for live Football and the fans
          that make it. Our love for Football, blended with the romance that it
          provides has driven us to build Bootbag; a place fans can truly put
          their football knowledge and inner geek to unearth talent before their
          friends and other Bootbag scouts. Weâ€™re proud to make Bootbag the
          first real-life scouting game and we hope you enjoy the fun of pitting
          your knowledge against other fans.
          <br /><br />

          As fans ourselves we hope you like our game, and gain yourself some
          bragging rights amongst your friends in the process!
